<h1>Execution Order of Caching Rules</h1>
<h3><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is important to understand the order in which rules are executed. </span><strong>The caching rules are interpreted in the order they are provided. Newer rules that match an object that are also matched by a previous rule will override the previous rule for that object. This means one must ensure that the rules are ordered from “more general” to “more specific”.</strong> </span></h3>
<h3><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example:</span></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>The first rule will match all JPEG images on the site.</li>
<li>The second rule will match all JPEG images in the /album directory.</li>
<li>The third rule will match all JPEG images in the /album/special directory.</li>
</ul>
