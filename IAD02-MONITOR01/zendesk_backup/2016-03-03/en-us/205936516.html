<h1>Overview of RevAPM API</h1>
<p>RevAPM API provides you the tools to configure your service for your website needs.</p>
<p>Some points of interest are:</p>
<ul>
<li>All requests are only accessible via HTTPS and the endpoint is located at <code style="font-size: small;">api.revapm.net</code>.</li>
<li>RevAPM follows the CRUD approach and supports the request types GET, POST, PUT or DELETE.</li>
<li>The GET requests will fetch information about an object, the POST requests will create an object, the PUT request will update an object, and finally the DELETE requests will delete the object.</li>
<li>We do our best to have all our URLs be <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/A/API.html" target="_blank">RESTful</a>.</li>
</ul>
