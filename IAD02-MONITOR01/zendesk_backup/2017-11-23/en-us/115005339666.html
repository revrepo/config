<h1>FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p>Here are some frequently asked questions about nuu:bit's platform:</p>
<p><strong>Q. My web application has some long running processes (like generation of a large reports) and it takes a lot of time for my server to complete such requests. As the result I'm receiving timeout errors from your CDN servers. What's the default data read timeout and how can I change it?</strong></p>
<p>A. Our default data read timeout is 20 seconds and it can be changed on "<strong>General Settings</strong>" domain configuration tab (field "<strong>Data Read Timeout</strong>").</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. My website is using a "<em>naked</em>" domain (an Internet domain name without the "www" or any other subdomains. For example, nuubit.com is a naked domain but www.nuubit.com is not, because it contains the www subdomain). Can you handle such domains?</strong></p>
<p>A. Yes, we can handle a "<em>naked</em>" domain but you will need to migrate the DNS domain to our platform (powered by our DNS partner NS1). </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. How can I test my domain and SSL configuration changes before they are applied to my production configuration (and potentially negative affecting my end-users)? Do you have any kind of development/testing environment?</strong></p>
<p>A. We utilize the concept of so-called "<em>staging</em>" environment where your modified configuration is sent when you click on "<strong>Update</strong>" button (instead of "<strong>Publish</strong>" button). Please see portal page "<strong>Web</strong> -&gt; <strong>Staging Env.</strong>" for details how to use the staging environment.</p>
