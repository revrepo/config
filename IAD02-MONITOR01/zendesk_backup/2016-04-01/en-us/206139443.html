<h1>Concepts</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By default, the RevAPM edge proxy caches objects that simultaneously match </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the conditions below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The origin marks them as cacheable by returning either an Expires or a Cache-Control header with an s-max-age or max-age parameter larger than 0. If both are present, the Cache-Control header takes precedence. If both s-max-age and max-age are present, the former takes precedence. By default the object is cached for the duration specified by the origin:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Expires is present, but Cache-Control isn’t, the cache lifetime (referred to as time-to-live (TTL)) is the difference between the time specified by the header and the current time on the edge proxy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Cache-Control is present and its [s-]max-age is larger than zero, then TTL is the value, in seconds, specified by the [s-]max-age parameter.</span></li>
</ul>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>The object is requested through a GET or HEAD HTTP method. All other methods, such as POST, PUT and DELETE are not cached.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The browser doesn’t send any cookies with the request and the origin doesn’t set any cookies in the response. This behavior can be changed, as we will see later.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The object is public - that is, it doesn’t require authentication as signalled by the presence of an Authorization header in the request.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These restrictions make many, if not all objects uncacheable, mostly because the browser sends the domain cookies as part of every request for a resource in that domain, regardless of type. For example, it sends them both for HTML pages and images.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The workaround for this issue requires actual knowledge about the website structure. The cache needs to be told:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Which objects are cacheable and for how long, even if the origin doesn’t mark them as such.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Which objects are dynamically generated and, among these, which ones require cookies in order to generate the resource.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RevAPM Customer Portal allows the configuration of caching parameters for a domain. Currently, the interface allows a user to configure a list of caching rules in JSON format, as described in the section </span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/205821996-RevAPM-Caching-Rules"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RevAPM Caching Rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us now look at how the cache actually works:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A request for a resource is received from the browser.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check that all the conditions for cacheability of this resource, defined above, are met for the request:</span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>If at least one of them isn’t met:</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent9">a. Download the object from the origin.<br />b. Override the browser TTL if necessary (see <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/205821996-RevAPM-Caching-Rules">RevAPM Caching Rules</a>).<br />c. Return it to the browser without caching it.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the object is deemed cacheable:</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent4">a. Compute a hash value, composed of:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>The domain name.</li>
<li>The full URL, containing the query string, if present. (The query string behavior can be controlled, as described below.)</li>
<li>The user agent capabilities. These capabilities are taken from the “User-Agent” request HTTP header, although the full “User-Agent” header is not used.</li>
<li>The set of request cookies that are relevant for the object, as defined through caching rules (see <a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="/hc/en-us/articles/205821996-RevAPM-Caching-Rules">RevAPM Caching Rules</a>).</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent4">b. Check if the cache already contains an unexpired object associated with this hash value. The “stale” object TTL default is 10 seconds.</p>
<ol start="3">
<ul>
<li>If it does:</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent9">i. Override the browser TTL if necessary (see <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/205821996-RevAPM-Caching-Rules">RevAPM Caching Rules</a>).<br />ii. Return the cached object.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent4">c. If the object is not in the cache or it is expired, download the object from the origin.<br />d. Check that all the conditions for cacheability of this resource, defined above, are met for the response:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>If at least one of them isn’t met:</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent9">i. Override the browser TTL if necessary (see <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/205821996-RevAPM-Caching-Rules">RevAPM Caching Rules</a>).<br />ii. Return the object to the browser without caching it.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent4">e. The object is cacheable.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent9">i. Compute the TTL of the object.<br />ii. Insert it into the cache and associate it with the previously computed hash value.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-indent4">f. Override the browser TTL if necessary (see <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/205821996-RevAPM-Caching-Rules">RevAPM Caching Rules</a>).<br />g. Return the object to the browser.<br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that given the manner in which the hash value is computed, there can be more than one instance of the same object in the cache at any time:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One instance for each user agent with different capabilities (mobile/desktop, supported HTML features, WebP support etc.).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One instance for each combination of query parameters and their values, if present.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One instance for each combination of cookies and their values, if cookies are allowed (see </span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/205821996-RevAPM-Caching-Rules"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RevAPM Caching Rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></li>
</ul>
