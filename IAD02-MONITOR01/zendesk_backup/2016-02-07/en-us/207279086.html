<h1>iOS SDK Rev Portal Configuration Management</h1>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This document provides information to facilitate the Rev iOS SDK configuration settings manager. For information the capabilities and benefits of the SDK, please see the ‘<a href="/hc/en-us/articles/207599093-RevSDK-Introduction">Introduction to the Rev SDK</a>’.</span></p>

<h1><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">SDK Release versions</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it is expected that over time the Rev SDK functionality will change and extend, possibly with changes not fully compatible between different SDK versions it is possible to specify different application configurations for different SDK release versions.</span></p>
<h1><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Operation mode</span></strong></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The operation mode is selected via a pull down menu in the portal interface that controls the SDKs primary operation. The modes are:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transfer (transfer_only)</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interception and acceleration of mobile application traffic is enabled. The transfer of traffic mode will be based on the allowed protocols and their availability on individual mobile devices.   The transferred traffic will also be based on the domain white lists, black lists and provisioned list.   </span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Report (report_only)</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the report mode, there is no interception of traffic. Reporting will be enabled based on the logging level settings.   Reports will also be sent based on the reporting interval, configured in seconds. </span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transfer and Report</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the reporting and transfer modes, intercepted traffic will be reported.  The transfer of  traffic will based on the allowed protocols.   The transferred traffic will be based on the domain white lists, black lists and provisioned list. Reporting will be enabled based on the logging will depending on setting.   Logs will also be sent based on the reporting interval, configured in seconds. </span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Off</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SDK interception and reporting functionalities will be turned off and the SDK will transparently send all data transfer request directly to data origin servers.</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">SDK Configuration Refresh Interval</span></strong><strong><strong><br /></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The refresh interval determines  the amount of time the SDK waits between checking if there is a new configuration.   The recommended value is 3600 seconds or once a day after setup and initial testing is complete .  This will keep the SDK from using the radio and draining the device battery unnecessarily.  Shorter intervals should be used on initial deployment (the default value is 1 hour).</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">SDK Configuration Stale Timeout</span></strong></p>
<p>The configuration stale timeout is a safeguard for the App and SDK.  If this timeout is reached it indicates  that the SDK on a mobile device failed to fetch a new configuration during the specified period of time since the last configuration update, and at that point the SDK will stop sending any data or stats requests to the Rev platform. Data requests then will be sent directly to customer origin servers (transparent mode of SDK operation). This should be set to a high value depending on the App usage (the default value is 10 hours).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Allowed transport protocols</span></strong><strong><strong><br /></strong></strong></p>
<p>The SDK can function using either of two protocols – an UDP-based protocol RMP (Rev Mobile Protocol) or TCP-based protocol DOTS (Dynamically Optimized Transport System). For more information on these two options, please see the Introduction to Rev SDK document. [include link to KB]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This option is a radio button.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Initial transport protocol</span></strong></p>
<p>The two choices are DOTS or RMP.  Since DOTS is a TCP variant, it is fully compatible with any network conditions.  Using RMP first could cause the App to start slower in some network conditions, such as using Wi-Fi in an enterprise environment.  That said, RMP will provide faster performance for the App on initialization.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-medium">Reporting interval</span></strong></p>
<p>The reporting interval is time between sending reporting data to the Rev platform. The default value is 120 seconds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Domain white list</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The white list is a basic access control mechanism that accelerated (transfers via RevAPM global network) only 3rd party traffic that is contained in this list. Domains in the white list will have cacheable content cached on the Rev edge. Rev will respect the rules of the caching headers for the given content.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Domain black list</strong></p>
<p>The blacklist is a basic access control mechanism that transfers all content, to include 3rd party content, except for the domain of the black list (i.e. list of denied accesses).  This is a JSON array. All other domain that are NOT in this list will have cacheable content cached at the Rev edge.  Rev will cache 3rd content based on the contents caching headers.  As an example, you see mathtag.com and google-analytics.com excluded from the transport. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Domains provisioned list</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A provisioned domain is configured in the Rev platform.  The domain will be able to be managed by the </span><a href="/hc/en-us/categories/200833373-RevAPM-API"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rev APIs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the content caching can be controlled by Rev’s </span><a href="/hc/en-us/articles/205821996-RevAPM-Caching-Rules"><span style="font-weight: 400;">caching rules</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
