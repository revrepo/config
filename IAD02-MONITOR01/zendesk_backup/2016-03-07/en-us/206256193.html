<h1>URL Query String</h1>
<p>Removing the query string from the URL can significantly increase a website's performance. In RevAPM, you can configure the behavior of the query string in the RevAPM Customer Portal. To remove the need for any query string, you can enter a unique but non-existent string. In this case, because the string will not be found, no query string parameters are obeyed. Â </p>
